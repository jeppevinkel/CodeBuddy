# CodeBuddy Performance Dashboard Guide

## Overview
The CodeBuddy Performance Dashboard provides real-time visualization and analysis of performance metrics across different code validators and languages. This guide explains how to use the dashboard effectively and interpret its data.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Real-Time Metrics Chart
- Displays live performance data for CPU utilization, memory usage, and execution time
- Click on any data point to access detailed drill-down analysis
- Hover over chart lines to see exact values
- Auto-updates every 5 seconds with new data

### 2. Filtering Panel
- Filter metrics by:
  - Programming language
  - Test type
  - Date range
- Applied filters affect all dashboard components
- Use multiple filters simultaneously for precise analysis

### 3. Trend Analysis
- Shows historical performance trends
- Helps identify gradual performance degradation
- Color-coded indicators for trend direction
- Baseline comparison with previous periods

### 4. Alert Panel
- Displays active performance alerts
- Color-coded by severity:
  - Red: Critical issues
  - Yellow: Warnings
  - Green: Normal operation
- Click alerts for detailed information

### 5. Comparison View
- Compare current performance against baseline
- Percentage changes highlighted
- Historical comparison available
- Identify performance regressions

### 6. Drill-Down Analysis
Access detailed metrics by clicking chart points:
- CPU Usage Breakdown
- Memory Allocation Patterns
- Garbage Collection Metrics
- Thread Analysis
- I/O Operations
- Network Usage

### 7. Export Functionality
- Export data in JSON format
- Select date range for export
- Include/exclude specific metrics
- Choose between summary and detailed export

## Interpreting the Data

### Performance Metrics
1. CPU Utilization
   - Normal range: 0-70%
   - Warning threshold: 70-85%
   - Critical threshold: >85%

2. Memory Usage
   - Normal range: 0-75%
   - Warning threshold: 75-90%
   - Critical threshold: >90%
   - Watch for sustained high usage

3. Execution Time
   - Baseline varies by validator
   - Compare against historical averages
   - Note sudden spikes

### Trend Analysis
- Upward trends in resource usage require investigation
- Compare trends across different languages
- Consider seasonal patterns
- Look for correlations between metrics

### Alerts
#### Critical Alerts (Red)
- Immediate action required
- May indicate system instability
- Could affect production performance

#### Warnings (Yellow)
- Investigation recommended
- May indicate emerging issues
- Monitor for escalation

#### Information (Blue)
- Normal system events
- No immediate action required
- Useful for tracking patterns

## Best Practices

### Daily Monitoring
1. Check active alerts
2. Review trend changes
3. Verify baseline comparisons
4. Investigate any anomalies

### Weekly Analysis
1. Export and review weekly reports
2. Analyze long-term trends
3. Update baseline if needed
4. Review alert patterns

### Performance Optimization
1. Use drill-down analysis to identify bottlenecks
2. Compare similar validators across languages
3. Monitor impact of code changes
4. Track optimization effectiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Spike in Resource Usage
   - Check recent code changes
   - Review concurrent operations
   - Analyze drill-down metrics

2. Persistent High Memory
   - Investigate memory leaks
   - Review garbage collection patterns
   - Check memory allocation trends

3. Slow Execution Time
   - Compare with baseline
   - Check system load
   - Review related resources

### Getting Help
- Contact system administrators for persistent issues
- Report bugs through the issue tracker
- Document unusual patterns
- Share exported data when reporting problems
